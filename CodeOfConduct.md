## Working group best practices
Below are some bullet points, adapted and expanded from our CIEE Guide for Virtual WG, a Canadian Standard Association Technical Committee Roles and Responsibilities document and a draft best practices document from the sDIV Synthesis Centre in Leipzig, Germany. If you have any questions or additions, please contact amooers@sfu.ca.
### Main aspects to consider for the group as a whole
- Build a trustful & collegial atmosphere.
- Foster inclusive communication.
- Ensure participants are prepared.
- Show enthusiastic leadership and enthusiastic participation.
- Foster active engagement & participation of all participants.
- Share workload among participants.
- Have fun while working towards feasible goals.
### Some Best Practices at group level
- Have group engaged way ahead the meeting.
- Get socialized.
- Let everyone speak. A bit of silence while folks ponder something is a good thing.
- Take lots of notes.
- Distribute session leads and note-taking duties among participants.
- Discuss and agree on authorship/data sharing rules at the meeting.
- Don't assume grad students and post-docs have "lots of extra time" to work.
- Make plans for future tasks, next steps and aims at the meeting when everyone is there.
### Some Best Practices at individual level
- Be courteous, respectful, generous and polite (no kidding).
- Allow others to express their opinion without interruption. Give everyone ample time.
- Focus the discussion on the issues and outcomes.
- Seek ways to bring closure to issues.
- Understand others' perspectives and needs.
- Stay focused; limit technology use to scheduled breaks and put cell phones away.
